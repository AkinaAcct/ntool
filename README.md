## Installation

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnyyaa/ntool/main/install) v0.6.2
```

Also, you can choose which branch to use.  Each branch has been **partially** tested and has better stability.  However, the main branch has **fewer tests**, including the latest functions and unknowable bugs.  If you like, use the following format to specify branch versions:  

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnyyaa/ntool/main/install) [BRANCH]
```
