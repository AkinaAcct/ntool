**PAY ATTENTION!**  

**MOST OF THE FUNCTIONS IN NTOOL HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED ENOUGH. THEY MAY HAVE UNEXPECTED BUGS, SOME OF WHICH MAY EVEN BREAK YOUR SYSTEM.**

## Installation

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnyyaa/ntool/main/install)
```

Also, you can choose which branch to use.  Each branch has been **partially** tested and has better stability.  However, the main branch has **fewer tests**, including the latest functions and unknowable bugs.  If you like, use the following format to specify branch versions:  

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnyyaa/ntool/main/install) [BRANCH]

```
